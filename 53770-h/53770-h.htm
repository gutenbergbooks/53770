<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This humble little work is the outcome of personal
interest and some lecture work in the field of
Hymnology. I trust that this little volume will be of
some value, especially to fellow Lutheran organists and
choir directors. For further study the student is referred
to John Julian&rsquo;s great &ldquo;Dictionary of Hymnology&rdquo;
and Benson&rsquo;s &ldquo;The English Hymn,&rdquo; as well as works
by Duffield, Breed, Ninde, and others. Every organist
and choir director ought to read &ldquo;The Hymn as Literature&rdquo;
by Jeremiah Bascom Reeves.</p>

<h2 id="c1">SECTION I
<br />THE HYMNODY OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH</h2>
<p>The hymnody of the Lutheran Church is the body
of sacred songs sung by the Church. These songs may
be studied in their twofold aspect; as to their religious
and as to their poetical character; they are <i>church hymns</i>
and also <i>sacred poems</i>.</p>
<p>(The Lutheran church hymns have been called
psalms. According to old linguistic usage, psalm is
the same thing as sacred or religious song, not song
in general. In secular Greek the word psalm does not
mean song, but it refers more particularly to the ability
or technique in playing upon stringed instruments&mdash;the
Greek word &ldquo;psalmos&rdquo; means to play a stringed
instrument. By psalm we mean a sacred song or lyric,
as of the Old Testament Book of Psalms; a hymn.)</p>
<h3 id="c2">THE RELIGIOUS CHARACTER</h3>
<p>With respect to the religious character of the
Lutheran church hymns, it must be quite clear that if
these hymns have grown up out of the soil of the
Church, if they are expressions of the spirit of the
Church, then they ought to reflect quite faithfully the
nature and peculiarities of the Church. The Church,
the Communion of Saints, where the Gospel is preached
in its purity and where the Sacraments are administered
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
according to the teachings of the Gospel, may be considered
partly with regard to the unique <i>religious life-content</i>,
which is communicated to the faithful through
the Word and the Sacraments and which not only unites
them to Christ, the Head of the Church, but also unites
them with one another; partly with regard to her nature
as a <i>congregation</i>, a communion or community in external
form with characteristic expressions and order
of life. The same twofold point of view arises in our
study of the church hymns. The religious character of
the church hymn may, therefore, be determined partly
from the point of view of religious life, having its
source and standard in Holy Writ, and partly from
the point of view of the church communion or the
congregation, of whose common life the church hymn
is an expression and reflection, and whose common
purpose it seeks to promote. The religious character
of the church hymn thus centers in the fact that both
as to content and form it must be Biblical and congregational.</p>
<p>1. The Biblical character of the church hymn:</p>
<p>First of all, the church hymn must be thoroughly
Biblical. It cannot move only in the realm of general
religious truth, not only sing the praise of certain abstract
ideas about God&rsquo;s being, about the immortality
of the soul, about virtue, etc. Not even such subjects
as God&rsquo;s attributes, the providence of God, Creation,
&ldquo;man&rsquo;s physical and spiritual attributes, reason, will,
conscience, nature and purpose,&rdquo; have any place in the
hymns of the Church, when these subjects are treated
in an abstract way, isolated from God&rsquo;s revelation
through Jesus Christ and detached from human life.
The subject of the church hymn, provided it possesses
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
sound religious character, is, briefly stated, <i>Christ for
us and Christ in us</i>; on the one hand the objective saving
grace through Jesus Christ, and on the other hand the
subjective appropriation of faith, with love and submission
and devotion to God. The sphere of the church
hymn will not thereby be restricted to an incessant
reiteration of the name of Jesus, his wounds and blood,
his love, etc. The church hymn sings the praise of
God&rsquo;s entire means of salvation: God&rsquo;s thoughts and
works of love through Christ for humanity; His sure
and saving institutions of grace upon earth; the work
of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of men unto repentance,
faith and sanctification; the benefits, struggles and victories
of His kingdom of grace; the glory of the heavenly
bridegroom; death and judgment; the world to come
and eternal life. All these subjects become the object
of the hymns of the Church. The faithful express
through the church hymn their ardent desire for these
things; they meditate upon these things, they rejoice
in their possession, they describe them and they extol
them; they adore, thank, and laud their Saviour, and
they give themselves up to God. Since the content of
positive Christian faith, or God&rsquo;s revelation of salvation
through Jesus Christ, is the principal subject of
the church hymn, it is clear that the church hymn must
be in perfect harmony with the Word of God, the
Bible, the very source of the revelation of salvation.
But this does not mean that the Church should use
exclusively the hymns of the Bible, as, for example,
the Psalms of David. It is perfectly well to use other
hymns, provided they are permeated by the Holy Spirit
and constitute a vital reproduction of Biblical truths,
grown up out of the soul-experiences of the Church in
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
perfect harmony with Holy Writ. Then the liturgical
principles of truth and freedom will come into proper
use in congregational hymn singing.</p>
<p>With this character of religious truth in the
objective sense, or the conformity of the church hymn
to Holy Writ, goes also the matter of religious truth
in the subjective or psychological sense. This means
that the religious experience, expressed in the church
hymn, is not merely a product of human imagination,
more or less foreign to those who gather their spiritual
life and their soul experiences from the fountain of
Holy Writ under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, but
it is far more an experience gained from the reality of
true spiritual life, and thoroughly accordant therewith,
something to which, therefore, every true Christian can
easily agree.</p>
<p>Finally, the Biblical character of the true church
hymn reveals itself also in the style of language, which
follows very closely Biblical expression, idiom and form.
The language of the church hymn harmonizes very
well with that type of religious language which has
attained a deep appreciation among Christians; the language
of the popular old religious books of the Church;
Biblical language. This old hymnic language possesses
very decidedly a character of immortality, depending
upon the character of the content, whose linguistic
garb it is, and with which it has become so closely
united. As the content is rooted in eternity and fundamentally
consists of God&rsquo;s incorruptible thoughts and
works, so the hymnic language, which is the vessel for
these realities of the eternal world, in a way also attains
a character of eternity. The history of the church hymns
also shows very clearly that whenever this peculiar
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
character of hymnic language has been disregarded,
whenever there have been vigorous attempts at modernization
of the good old church hymns, when new and
modern hymns have been sought, to satisfy some modern
aesthetic or aristocratic need, then the true church
hymn has suffered very greatly and lost much of its
original soundness and genuineness. Indeed, the hymn
writer, like any other poet, is influenced more or less
by his age; his hymns may show more or less the influence
of the peculiar turn of mind, the stage of development
and the demands of the age in which he
lives; personal ability as a poet and personal life experiences
may be distinctly reflected in his hymns. But
it should also be true, that if the poet is a sincere student
and lover of the Bible and delights in singing its praises,
then his hymns ought to possess Biblical tone and content,
since there is a very close union between content
and form in every human religious product. A church
hymn possessing Biblical tone and language ought to
be understood and appreciated by the present age.
Biblical language is antique but it will never be antiquated;
it is old but eternally new and youthful. In
all ages and in all churches the thoroughly Biblical
church hymn holds the prize for youthful health and
beauty.</p>
<p>2. The congregational character of the church hymn:</p>
<p>In the second place, the church hymn should be
suitable for use in the congregation, it should possess
a congregational character. This quality of the church
hymn implies, of course, that it must not contain anything
which is at variance with the confession or the
doctrines of the Church. The Lutheran Church may use
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
hymns that have been written by non-Lutheran hymn
writers, provided these hymns contain nothing offensive
to sound Lutheran doctrine. So Lutheran hymnals
may contain hymns taken from the Reformed Churches,
and Reformed church hymnals may contain many
Lutheran hymns.</p>
<p>The congregational element in the Lutheran church
hymn further means that it must be free from all unsound
and unjustifiable subjectivity. The church hymn
is the work of a poet who is vitally united with the
religious organism&mdash;he is a member of the Church&mdash;and
from this consciousness of perfect communion his
hymns emerge. Writes Dr. Martin Luther: &ldquo;Church
hymns are so called, because the Church has accepted
them and uses them as if produced by the Church and
as her own hymns. We do not say: thus sings Ambrose,
Gregory the Great, Prudentius, Sedulius; but we say:
thus sings the Christian Church. It is the songs of
the Church that Ambrose, Prudentius and others sing
with the Church and the Church with them; when they
are dead and gone, the Church remains, and continues
to sing their songs.&rdquo; Personal poetic gifts and temporal
conditions and circumstances influence the church hymns.
The true church hymn does not lack individuality; but
it is free from individualism. The experiences which
the church hymn expresses, the soul states which it
describes, should not be of an extreme, a singular or
an abnormal character, but they should be normal and
common to the Church. Not that the church hymn must
restrict itself to what every member, in whatsoever
condition of spiritual life, would readily subscribe to.
Such a requirement would be unreasonable, because the
participants in divine worship have reached different
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
stages of spiritual development; in fact, this would restrict
the subject matter of the church hymn to only
certain general facts and abstract ideas. But it must
be required of every church hymn that it express only
such religious experiences as are <i>in the main</i> common
to the whole communion of the faithful, only such
soul states and spiritual stages of development as are
<i>essentially</i> experienced by every true Christian.</p>
<p>If the requirement of community in the church
hymnody permits dealing with special situations and
experiences in the realm of spiritual life, then it ought
to follow that this character of community will not be
violated if the content of the church hymn bears upon
certain external conditions and circumstances in which
the entire congregation never can find itself at any
one time. Since there are liturgical acts which directly
affect only certain individuals in the congregation, not
the congregation as a whole, there may be church
hymns for certain individuals and special occasions.
There are church hymns for marriage, confirmation,
ordination, etc. It is also perfectly well to have church
hymns for the aged, for the sick, for the dying, for prisoners,
in time of war, etc. Since the church members should
be kindly and lovingly interested in each other, the congregation
may well give expression to certain sympathetic
feelings in the church hymns. But such conditions
and circumstances in the life of an individual as
are quite exceptional and of special interest only to
him, not to the congregation as such, are unsuitable
as subjects for church hymns, since they may quite
easily form a disturbing digression from that character
of community which should distinguish the church
hymns as such. Hymns &ldquo;for a father or a mother at
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
New Year, for a poor young man, for a young lady,
for a blind man,&rdquo; and the like, really have no place
in the hymnal.</p>
<p>The congregational character of the church hymn
also finds expression in the language and style of presentation.
This must be plain and clear, so that the
hymn may be easily understood and appreciated by
all who possess a reasonable religious training, young
or old. The mode of expression is original, naive,
true-hearted and graphic. The true church hymn avoids
startling phrases, prettiness, and mere rhetoric.</p>
<h3 id="c3">THE POETICAL QUALITY</h3>
<p>The other point of view from which the church
hymn may be considered is the poetical; the church
hymn is a <i>song</i> thus a product of poetical art. Before
attempting to analyze the poetical quality of the church
hymn, it may be well to consider what kinds of poetry
are used in the hymnody of the Church.</p>
<p>The three main kinds of poetry are the epic, the
drama, and the lyric. Epic and drama are not extensively
used in the Lutheran Church. Works exist which
show that the graphic and plastic style of epic poetry
has been employed in the Christian Church when stories
from sacred history were paraphrased in metrical form.
The Gospel lessons have often been read or chanted in
metrical form, as hymns. This poetical work may be
classified as didactic hymnody with an epic touch. The
epic, strictly speaking, requires an imaginative adornment
of the historical material to be treated, and this
cannot very well be applied to Biblical history without
a certain amount of injury. Besides, it would be difficult
to excel the beauty of the Biblical presentation,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
with its pre-eminent epic vividness and simplicity. The
mediaeval Church employed the dramatic form in the
mysteries and miracles, religious plays, which were used
especially at great festival occasions to present to the
laity in a dramatic and effective way the historical facts
pertaining to the festival. More closely related to the
Christian cultus was the Passion play, performed by the
clergy in the churches during Lent. The Passion play,
and a number of dramatic-liturgical ceremonies, especially
at Christmas and Easter, were quite freely
employed in the early Lutheran Church. But this dramatic
activity did not remain permanently in the Lutheran
Church. Perhaps the Church felt that the dramatic
reproduction of Biblical history did not harmonize
very well with that element of personal truth which
must exist throughout the cultus and which may suffer
injury as the dramatic illusion becomes greater.</p>
<p>While epic and dramatic poetry have little or no
place in the Evangelical Lutheran cultus, and so can
not very well be employed in the hymnody of the Church,
the third kind of poetry, the lyric, is very extensively
used. A noteworthy characteristic of lyrical poetry is
that the object of the song is most closely united with
the singing subject; they are as one; the object lives
within the subject and is the real content of the subject.
If the cultus is a meeting between God and the Church,
in which God imparts his gifts to the congregation and
the latter faithfully receives, enjoys, and acknowledges
the divine gifts of grace; a meeting, in other words,
in which the divine objects join the worshipping subject,
in which the latter is permeated by the former,
then it seems only very natural that religious lyrical
poetry should here find its proper use; when the worshipping
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
congregation gives expression to its life of
faith and love through sacred song, through the hymns
of the Church, these hymns are lyrical poetry.</p>
<p>Although the fusion of the object and the subject
is a characteristic feature of all religious lyrics, it is
to be noted that these two elements, the objective and
the subjective, are never present in equal degree in
the church hymns, but that the one or the other element
predominates, wherefore it becomes necessary to classify
the church hymns into the <i>relatively objective</i> hymns
and the <i>relatively subjective</i> hymns. To the former
class belong the hymn proper and the didactic or doctrinal
hymns; the latter class, the lyrical hymns in a
narrower sense, consists of what may be called hymns
of experience and sacrifice. The hymn proper sings
the praises of God&rsquo;s majesty and highness, God&rsquo;s glorious
works and attributes, not as something wholly outside
of the subject, yet something which is looked up
to with worshipful joy and admiration. &ldquo;A mighty
Fortress is our God&rdquo; is a good example of this class
of church hymns. The didactic or doctrinal hymn presents
for quiet and instructive contemplation either certain
facts from sacred history or certain parts of the
Lutheran doctrine. Examples of this kind are &ldquo;Nun
freut euch, lieben Christen g&rsquo;mein&rdquo; and &ldquo;Es ist das Heil
uns kommen her.&rdquo; In these relatively objective hymns,
true church hymns, the objective element is more or
less permeated by the life, emotion, and sympathy of
the subject. In the hymn proper the subject sings its
own joy and its jubilation in the great God and His
glorious works. The didactic or doctrinal hymn is
not merely rhymed history or rhymed dogmatics, but in
it the divine events and truths are celebrated as treasures
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of faith, sources of spiritual life; by means of it the
congregation embraces, acknowledges and utters its confident
Yea and Amen to the divine revelation of salvation.
The relatively subjective church hymns, the
lyrical church hymns in a restricted sense, may be
characterized as hymns of experience, because they describe
and express religious life in its inner experience,
emotions, conditions and manifestations, or because they
include meditations which a Christian engages in because
of his inner and outer condition; to this class of church
hymns belong also the so-called hymns of sacrifice, which
are more directly an expression of individual devotion to
Jesus Christ. Since the chiefly subjective hymns, because
of their nature, are subject to the danger of losing
themselves in the individual and the incidental, it
is very important that they be supported and permeated
by a sound religious philosophy. God&rsquo;s revelation of
salvation, especially Jesus Christ, who in His person
and work is at once the vital cause, the life, and the
living standard of all the various phenomena and forms
in the world of divine grace and truth, must form the
background which everywhere gleams forth in the
hymnody of the Church, the sun that gives light and
warmth to the content, the perfect law which restricts
the description and keeps the subjectivity within proper
bounds.</p>
<p>Since the church hymn is lyrical poetry, it should
be beautiful. But the beauty of the church hymn consists
in what? It must be emphasized that this beauty
is not something applied to the church hymn from
without, but this beauty grows up naturally and spontaneously
out of the subject which is to be celebrated
in song. This beauty is nothing else than the faithful
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
reflection, the telling concrete revelation of its inner
harmony, nobility and sublimity. The communion of
the congregation with God through Jesus Christ, which
seeks concrete expression in the church hymn, is in
itself the highest, the most noble, and the most harmonious
of all the realities of human life. When this
divine communion seeks expression in the church hymn,
then the poetical art to be employed must be such as
will adequately express and convey the emotions and
experiences peculiar to this communion. The inner
harmony of the matter should reveal itself in the poetical
form of presentation as outer harmony, as beauty. The
entire tone of the church hymn will then become, by
an inner necessity, graceful, elevated, sublime. It is
to be noted that this hymnic beauty is modified according
to the specific character of the hymn. In the
church hymn proper, like &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg,&rdquo; this hymnic
beauty is more elevated, majestic, sublime. In the didactic
or doctrinal hymn, it is characterized by the
purity, positiveness, and sonorousness of the faithful
testimony of truth. In the lyrical church hymn in a
restricted sense, it is more colored by subjective qualities
such as fervor, sincerity, and affection. The lyrical
beauty of the church hymn is free from ostentation;
it is distinguished by simplicity and naturalness. This
simplicity of expression is a poetical as well as a congregational
requirement. Also, the entire presentation
of the subject must bear the impress of spontaneity, of
freshness. The church hymn should not present abstract
ideas, reflective thought, conceptions, and definitions;
but, instead, it should present to the eyes of the heart
living pictures, concrete realities; just as the Biblical
presentation, which the church hymn must follow, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Christianity itself, which the church hymn must reflect,
pre-eminently possess this character of concrete and
vital reality.</p>
<p>The beauty of the church hymn implies further
that its line of thought and disposition be clear and
well arranged, that each stanza express a complete
thought, and that there be not too many stanzas&mdash;the
church hymn must not be too long. The phraseology,
syntax and metrical form must be free from such defects
as mar and desecrate the sublime content of the
hymn or make it offensive, unclear, or even incomprehensible
to the congregation. This does not mean to
commend that vandalism whereby modernists have
sought to remove from the old church hymns every obsolete
word and construction as well as everything which
seemed to be at variance with the rules of secular poetry&mdash;a
process whereby many excellent old church hymns
have been deprived of their original power and simplicity.
Most certainly, revision and purification of the
outer form of the old church hymns is sometimes necessary,
in order to make them popularly intelligible and
usable. But such revision and purification should be
undertaken only by Christians of poetic mind and sound
authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h2 id="c4">SECTION II
<br />THE LUTHERAN HYMN BOOK OR THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE HYMNS IN THE HYMNAL</h2>
<p>Two different hymnological methods of disposition
have arisen historically within the Church, namely, the
<i>dogmatic</i> or the <i>dogmatic-ethical</i> method, and the <i>liturgical</i>
method. The former method came into existence
in the eighteenth century. By this method the hymns in
the hymnal are arranged according to the usual order
of dogmatics. For an illustration of this method of
arranging the hymns, look into almost any good hymnal
of the Reformed Church; The Methodist Hymnal, for
example. The liturgical method is the original, the
standard, and the correct method of disposition. In
support of this assertion, it may be well to observe that
since the Lutheran hymnal is a liturgical book, a book
intended for the needs of the worshipping congregation,
the succession of the hymns as well as their content
and character should reflect the spirit of the Church,
as it finds immediate expression in the cultus and its
various acts, and as it seeks indirectly to exert a hallowing
influence on social life in larger or smaller circles.</p>
<p>It may be well to take a general view of the main
factors or stages of this liturgical work of the Church,
so as to see more clearly what subjects may be considered
in the hymn book and in what order the various
subjects or rubrics may follow each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The reason and the vital basis for the existence of
the Church is God&rsquo;s revelation of salvation through
Jesus Christ, i. e., the incarnation and the work of
redemption of the Son of God and the sending of the
Holy Spirit; and these divine works of salvation are
the great objectives of the three great church festivals,
Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, around which the
cycles and days of the church year are grouped. The
Church is the result of this revelation. Therefore our
attention turns towards the Church, her nature, her
establishment, and her extension in this world through
missionary activity; further, toward her inner growth,
by which she gives expression to her religious and harmonious
life as a communion in solemn divine worship,
and through her sacred acts and order consecrates human
life unto a vessel for divine life. But this self-edification
is brought about in the Church only through
the Holy Spirit who dwells and lives within the Church
and in and through the Church and her institutions of
grace produces in the hearts of the redeemed personal
conversion, sanctification, and salvation. Thus the
Church grows both outwardly and inwardly and proceeds
towards her eternal perfection. But the Church
has to do not only with purely spiritual conditions, things
divine and eternal. By her life she seeks to permeate,
sanctify, and glorify all conditions, even the temporal.
The Church seeks to penetrate, in a highly beneficial
way, the civic community, to ennoble its affairs and
impart support and exhortation both to the governing
and the governed, in times of prosperity and in times
of trouble. The Church is deeply interested in her
educational institutions, these nurseries of time and
eternity; the Christian school is not only a creation of
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the Church, but it needs the whole-hearted support of
the Church. The Church is also deeply interested in
the welfare of domestic life&mdash;she seeks to make the
home a happy Christian home. The Church also desires
to support and accompany the individual member
throughout his course of life, especially in its more
difficult stages, so that this temporal life may lead to
eternal life.</p>
<p>If these are the most important factors in ecclesiastical-liturgical
activity, and if the church hymnal is to
be in perfect harmony with the life of the Church, then
the hymns in the hymnal may be arranged as follows:
1. <i>Festival Hymns</i>, arranged according to the festivals,
cycles and holy-days of the church year&mdash;Advent, Christmas,
New Year, Epiphany, etc. 2. <i>Hymns about the
Church and ecclesiastical acts</i>: the Word, the Church,
Missions, ecclesiastical acts (worship, Holy Baptism,
Holy Communion, confirmation, ordination and installation,
dedication of churches, etc., also marriage and
burial). 3. <i>Hymns about the Christian life</i>: repentance,
faith, justification and state of grace, sanctification (the
fruits of regeneration, prayer, cross and consolation),
the completion (the resurrection, judgment, eternity).
4. <i>Hymns for certain people, times and circumstances</i>:
the Christian community (fatherland, the authorities and
the subjects, judges and those suing for justice, temporal
necessities, war and peace, plagues and calamities,
etc.), the Christian school or Christian education, the
Christian home (husband and wife, parents and children,
master and servant, morning and evening hymns,
etc.), conditions in the life of an individual (health,
sickness, death, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="c5">GENERAL SURVEY OF THE HISTORY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH HYMNS</h2>
<h2 id="c6">SECTION III
<br />EARLY CHRISTIAN HYMNODY
<br />To About 600 A. D.</h2>
<p>The Christians of the first century sang hymns,
both in private and in public worship. The writings
of the New Testament testify to this fact, as for example
1 Cor., chapter 14, also the well known places Eph.
5:19 and Col. 3:16. To begin with the Christians
sang the hymns of the Old Testament, especially the
Psalms of David. Among early Christian songs, we
note the following: the Gloria in excelsis Deo (the
angelic hymn), the Gloria Patri, the Ter Sanctus (Isaiah
6:3), the Hallelujah, the Benedicite, the Nunc Dimittis
(Luke 2:29), the Magnificat (Luke 1:46), the Benedictus
(Luke 1:68), and the Te Deum Laudamus.</p>
<p>From Paul&rsquo;s references to sacred song in his epistles
we learn that the early Christians possessed hymns
of their own composition, besides the Bible songs. But
we know very little about these very early hymns of
the Apostolic Age; we know of no great hymn writer
of that age. One of the earliest hymn writers that we
know of is Clement of Alexandria, who lived about 200
A. D. To him is attributed the Greek hymn, &ldquo;Shepherd
of tender youth,&rdquo; which has been regarded as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
first Christian hymn. It is found in most of our standard
American hymnals&mdash;number 282 in Common Service
Book. In 1846 this hymn was freely translated into
English by Rev. Dr. Henry Martyn Dexter, editor of
The Congregationalist, Boston.</p>
<h3 id="c7">EARLY GREEK HYMNS</h3>
<p>Looking at the Christian ancestry of our church
hymnody, in a narrower way, it may be said that its
history goes back to the hymn writing of christianized
Greece&mdash;1500 years back&mdash;1500 years of Christian hymn
writing and hymn singing. The church hymnody of
the different countries varies, of course, in time and
duration. A German, for example, finds about seven
hundred years of German hymn writing in his hymn
book. We have inherited and appropriated this common
legacy.</p>
<p>In Syria there arose in the second century several
prolific hymn writers. They were Gnostics, who sought
to propagate their heretical teachings through sacred
song. Bardesanes and his son Harmonius were the
leaders of this Gnostic hymnody in the Syriac Church.
This heretical hymnody was the negative cause of the
great hymn writing of Ephrem Syrus, who was born
at Nisibis in Northern Mesopotamia, 307 A. D., and
died at Edessa, 373. He is regarded as the foremost
representative of the orthodox hymnody of the old
Syriac Church. In order to counteract the dangerous
influences of Gnosticism, Ephrem Syrus produced a
large number of fine hymns, which became very popular
throughout the Eastern Church. Thus a new era in
Christian hymnody was introduced. See pages 63-68 in
&ldquo;The Hymn as Literature,&rdquo; by J. B. Reeves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Like the Gnostics of Syria in the second century,
so also the Arians of Constantinople in the fourth century
sought to propagate their heretical doctrines
through sacred song. Again great champions of orthodoxy
arose, men like Ephrem Syrus, who produced
fine hymns, mainly in defense of the doctrines of the
Trinity and Christ&rsquo;s divine nature. Among early well
known Greek hymn writers we note the following:
Gregory of Nazianzus (died 389), Anatolius (seventh
or eighth century), St. Andrew of Jerusalem (660-732),
St. Cosmas, the Melodist (died about 760), St. John
of Damascus (died about 780), St. Stephen of St. Sabas
(died 794), and St. Joseph the Hymnographer (died
about 840). As examples of their hymns we have &ldquo;O
Thou the One supreme o&rsquo;er all&rdquo; by Gregory, &ldquo;The
day is past and over&rdquo; by Anatolius, &ldquo;The day of resurrection&rdquo;
by St. John of Damascus, and &ldquo;Art thou weary,
art thou languid&rdquo; by St. Stephen. Rev. Dr. John Mason
Neale (1818-1866) of East Grimstead, England, has produced
many excellent translations of the old Greek hymns,
which are found in nearly all modern hymnals.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Church, as early as the third century,
the custom of singing had become so general as
to be recognized as one of the Church&rsquo;s predominating
features. In the Eastern Church, at Antioch, antiphonal
congregational hymn singing had its origin, and from
thence spread in all directions in the fourth century.
An interesting fact comes to light in connection with
the use the Eastern Church made of its hymns. Theodoret,
in his historical writings, tells us that &ldquo;while
Chrysostom (347-407) was bishop of Constantinople,
at the opening of the fifth century, the orthodox Christians
were in the habit of assembling themselves in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
public squares, then marching in midnight processions,
through the city, singing sacred songs, in order to
combat those who were enemies of Christ&rsquo;s divinity.&rdquo;
This is a testimony concerning the anti-Arian hymnody.</p>
<p>The early hymnody of the Eastern Church possesses
a great deal of poetic beauty and fine rhetorical style.
But many of these old Greek hymns indulge in a certain
amount of tedious broadness and dogmatic prosiness.
They are often vague and fantastic. Fine language
seems often to be of greater importance than spiritual
content. In the Eastern Church sacred song never received
the development and the place in the life and the
cultus of the congregation as in the Western Church.
During the last half of the third century the Eastern
Church advocated the use of the Psalms of David only
in divine service. It must also be borne in mind that
attempts were made in the Eastern Church about the
middle of the fourth century to suppress congregational
singing. The character of the hymns that were produced
in the Eastern Church, their bombastic and often
turgid style, their complicated rhythmical structure, and
their unpractical Christianity, prevented them from becoming
a property of the common people.</p>
<h3 id="c8">EARLY LATIN HYMNS</h3>
<p>Early sacred song in the Western Church is characterized
by noble simplicity and clearness in form, as
well as by a more practical Christianity; fine qualities
which go to make the old Latin hymns more accessible
and serviceable to us than the old Greek hymns.</p>
<p>The fourth century witnessed a remarkable activity
in Latin hymnody. The Western Church was far more
active in the hymnological field than the Eastern Church.
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
One of the founders of Latin hymnody was St. Hilary,
the good bishop of Poitiers, great scholar, and great
defender of the Christian faith. During his exile (356-360)
in Phrygia, St. Hilary came in touch with Arian
hymn singing. When he was permitted to return to
Gaul, he brought with him a great enthusiasm for hymn
singing. He edited the first hymn book of the Western
Church, and introduced singing of orthodox hymns
among his people. He died in 368 A. D.</p>
<p>But the great author and leader of Latin hymnody
is, undoubtedly, St. Ambrose, the admirable and amiable
bishop of Milan. He was born in 340 and died on
Good Friday, 397. St. Ambrose has been called the
father of Latin church song, because of his great work
in hymnody and church music. The first stanza of
one of his beautiful hymns is here quoted.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Jesus, Lord of heavenly grace,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou Brightness of Thy Father&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou Fountain of eternal light,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose beams disperse the shades of night.</p>
</div>
<p>Prudentius (Aurelius Prudentius Clemens) is a
prominent Latin hymn writer of this period. He was
born in Spain, 348 A. D. Prudentius has been called
&ldquo;the first great Christian poet.&rdquo; With him the Latin,
the language of a stern and hard people, is, as it were,
tempered by faith. He, like most of the early Latin
hymnists, sings the praises of the faith, hope and love
of the Christian Church. The subjective, with its &ldquo;I,&rdquo;
&ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine,&rdquo; so characteristic of modern hymnody,
had no place in the hymns of Prudentius. He received
high honors from the Roman emperor, but in old age he
preferred to devote himself quietly to religious literary
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
work. He died about 410 A. D. We quote the first
stanza of a beautiful Christmas hymn, Corde natus ex
Parentis, from Prudentius, the translation by Neale.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Of the Father&rsquo;s love begotten,</p>
<p class="t0">Ere the worlds began to be,</p>
<p class="t0">He is Alpha and Omega,</p>
<p class="t0">He the source, the ending He,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the things that are, that have been,</p>
<p class="t0">And that future years shall see,</p>
<p class="t0">Evermore and evermore.</p>
</div>
<p>St. Patrick (fifth century), called the Apostle of
Ireland, wrote several hymns for his people. Coelius
Sedulius, of the fifth century, wrote several great Latin
hymns, among which we refer to one that has been
sung quite extensively, namely, A solis ortus cardine&mdash;From
lands that see the sun arise.</p>
<p>Gregory the Great (545-604) and Venantius Fortunatus
(530-609) mark a period of transition in the
hymn singing of the Western Church. It was at this
time, about 600 A. D., that the Ambrosian church song
was superseded by the Gregorian. Here it was that
congregational song in the Western Church was abandoned
and that part of public worship given over to
the priests and the monks. The only part the congregation
took was in a few responses. Gregory the Great
was a man of unusual ability. He was pope from 590
until his death in 604. He was a zealous missionary
to Britain, great as a champion against the heretics, and
great as a preacher, but his best service to the Church
is undoubtedly his liturgical and musical contribution.
He strove to make public worship worthy of Him to
whom it was rendered. It must be borne in mind that
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
good congregational singing was something which presented
great and perplexing problems in those days.
The Gregorian chants, still in use, after a lapse of
more than a dozen centuries, show the Gregorian style
and indicate how Gregory changed the melodious and
flowing hymns of St. Ambrose into the more severe
and solemn style of the new period. But we have
several hymns from Gregory&rsquo;s pen which indicate that
he was not without the Ambrosian spirit. Take, for
example, his beautiful hymn,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Christ, our King, Creator, Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Saviour of all who trust Thy word,</p>
<p class="t0">To them who seek Thee ever near,</p>
<p class="t0">Now to our praises bend Thine ear.</p>
</div>
<p>Venantius Fortunatus, the troubadour, holds a very
important place in early Latin hymnody. He wrote
one of the greatest hymns of the Western Church, namely,
Vexilla Regis&mdash;The royal banners forward go, the
Cross shines forth in mystic glow. We quote the first
stanza of another great hymn by Fortunatus, a grand
Easter hymn.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Welcome, happy morning! age to age shall say;</p>
<p class="t0">Hell today is vanquished; heaven is won today.</p>
<p class="t0">Lo! the Dead is living, God for evermore!</p>
<p class="t0">Him their true Creator, all His works adore.</p>
<p class="t0">Welcome, happy morning! age to age shall say.</p>
</div>
<p>Simplicity, depth, fervor, divine sentiment, full-hearted
confession, are some of the outstanding characteristics
of the early Latin hymns. They are, on the
whole, Scriptural, pure, and devotional. The key-note
in these venerable old hymns consists of the main points
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of Christianity, the protection and care of the Father,
the redemption of Christ, the sanctification of the Holy
Spirit, strains of thanksgiving and praise, invocation
of God&rsquo;s support against the devil, the flesh and the
world.</p>

<h2 id="c9">SECTION IV
<br />MEDIAEVAL CHRISTIAN HYMNODY
<br />A. D. 600-1520</h2>
<p>When the Western Church passed into the mediaeval
era of its history, about 600 A. D., we find church song
in a new and different situation. During the ancient
era of the Christian Church, it may be said that church
song was, for the most part, a song of the people of
God, a congregational song. Attempts had been made
before this time, it is true, to suppress congregational
song, but they had proven more or less unsuccessful.
During the Middle Ages, however, the Church was successful
in definitely transferring church song from the
people to the clergy and a well trained clerical choir.
Latin was the liturgical language of the entire Western
Church, wherefore the mediaeval church hymns were
written in that language. The Carolingian age, productive
in so many respects, also produced a number
of very beautiful hymns, resembling the best productions
of the Ambrosian era of hymnody. Charlemagne
was not only a zealous promoter but also a practiser of
sacred poesy. In the ninth century Notker Balbulus of
St. Gall monastery produced hymns called Sequences,
which differed in their metrical structure from the
older hymns. These Sequences had three or six lines
in each verse, while the verses of the older hymns had
four lines each. In a subsequent chapter we shall speak
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
more fully of the Sequences and their remarkable birthplace.</p>
<p>Passing over into the mediaeval Church, we find that
our church hymnody had three different sources in the
time before the Reformation. One source was the Latin
church hymnody. The second source consisted of the
German songs, called Leisen. The third source was
the religious folk-song of the common people.</p>
<h3 id="c10">MEDIAEVAL LATIN HYMNS</h3>
<p>During the second half of the Middle Ages, beginning
with the eleventh century, a number of great
hymn writers arose. King Robert of France, who died
1031 A. D., probably wrote one of the greatest hymns
of the Latin Church, namely, Veni Sancte Spiritus.
Dr. S. W. Duffield claims that this great Sequence was
written by Hermannus Contractus, the crippled monk
of Reichenau, in the eleventh century.</p>
<p>Bernard of Cluny and Bernard of Clairvaux are
two Latin hymn writers who hold a very important
place in Christian hymnody. From Bernard of Cluny
(twelfth century) comes the well known hymn, &ldquo;Jerusalem
the golden, with milk and honey blest.&rdquo; This
hymn comes from his famous and only poem Laus Patriae
Celestis which consists of some three thousand
lines of dactylic hexameter. We quote the first stanza
of another well known hymn that comes from the same
poem.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Brief life is here our portion;</p>
<p class="t">Brief sorrow, short-lived care;</p>
<p class="t0">The life that knows no ending,</p>
<p class="t">The tearless life, is there.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, happy retribution!</p>
<p class="t">Short toil, eternal rest;</p>
<p class="t0">For mortals, and for sinners,</p>
<p class="t">A mansion with the blest.</p>
</div>
<p>From St. Bernard of Clairvaux we have such great
hymns as &ldquo;Light of the anxious heart,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wide open are
Thy hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Jesus, King most wonderful,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus,
the very thought of Thee,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus, Thou Joy of loving
hearts,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Sacred Head, now wounded.&rdquo; St. Bernard
was born in Fountaines, Burgundy, 1091. History
speaks of him as highly imaginative, great champion of
the faith, great orator, great teacher, founder and abbot
of the Cistercian monastery at Clairvaux, and leader
in mediaeval mysticism. He died in 1153. Luther called
him &ldquo;the best monk that ever lived.&rdquo; Hymns from
the two Bernards can be found in any standard modern
hymn book and they are worth careful study.</p>
<p>Adam of St. Victor (twelfth century) is another
important Latin hymnist. He was choirmaster at the
great St. Victor monastery at Paris. Trench speaks of
him as &ldquo;the foremost among the sacred Latin poets of
the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas of Celano, whose birthplace is unknown,
was one of the first members of the Franciscan order.
In 1221 he went to Germany and remained there for
nine years; then he returned to Italy, where he died
in 1255. Thomas of Celano wrote the greatest hymn
of the Latin Church&mdash;Dies Irae. There are nineteen
verses to this great Sequence, of which we quote the
first two. The translation is by Wm. J. Irons.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Day of wrath, that Day of mourning,</p>
<p class="t0">See fulfilled the prophet&rsquo;s warning,</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven and earth in ashes burning.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O what fear man&rsquo;s bosom rendeth,</p>
<p class="t0">When from heaven the Judge descendeth,</p>
<p class="t0">On whose sentence all dependeth.</p>
</div>
<p>Thomas Aquinas was born in a Neapolitan castle,
Italy, about 1225. He was a Dominican and the strongest
of the scholastics, theological professor at several
universities, Doctor of Theology from Paris, also called
Doctor Angelicus. He was a prolific writer; his Summa
Theologiae is a great dogmatic work. He died in a
prominent monastery at Naples in 1274. Thomas Aquinas
produced a number of excellent hymns. His &ldquo;Lauda,
Sion, salvatorem&rdquo; is generally regarded as one of the
greatest hymns of Latin hymnody. It can be found
in almost any standard hymnal, beginning &ldquo;Sion, to
thy Saviour singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacoponus (died 1306) wrote one of the greatest
hymns of the Roman Church, namely, Stabat Mater
Dolorosa. This hymn is found in many Protestant
hymnals, beginning &ldquo;At the Cross her station keeping.&rdquo;
Thomas a Kempis (1380-1471) of Holland and John
Huss (1369-1415) of Bohemia, made valuable contributions
to mediaeval hymnody.</p>
<p>These Latin hymn writers have produced hymns
which are characterized by deep ardor, great love of
Christ, and soul-stirring earnestness. The Latin church
hymnody is very wealthy indeed; more than 20,000
Latin church hymns have been discovered. Of these
Latin hymns we have appropriated a large number of
beautiful festival church hymns. Their form is very
plain. Without any comment the festival subject is
presented in a very plain and simple statement of the
event in question. The singer loses himself in his subject;
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
there is nothing here of self-assertion. Note such
hymns as &ldquo;A great and mighty wonder,&rdquo; &ldquo;All praise to
Thee, Eternal Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;The strife is o&rsquo;er, the battle done,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Christ, the Lord, is ris&rsquo;n today,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus Christ is risen
today, Alleluia,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Mightily through the ages sound the hymns of
penance and judgment; perhaps too strong at times.
Note that mighty and most powerful hymn, Dies irae,
dies illa. But the mediaeval hymnody is not without
the evangelical spirit; this is clearly seen in our hymn
books, especially in the Communion hymns. In spite
of magic and abuse, it was nevertheless in the Holy
Communion that the true Christian of the Middle Ages
came closest to Christ. Note two mediaeval Communion
hymns:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord Jesus Christ! To Thee we pray,</p>
<p class="t0">From us God&rsquo;s wrath Thou turn&rsquo;st away,</p>
<p class="t0">Thine agony and bitter death</p>
<p class="t0">Redeem us from eternal wrath.</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn comes from John Huss and was translated
by Martin Luther. The other Communion hymn is
&ldquo;Jesu dulcis memoria,&rdquo; probably by St. Bernard of
Clairvaux:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, the very thought of Thee</p>
<p class="t0">With sweetness fills the breast;</p>
<p class="t0">But sweeter far Thy face to see,</p>
<p class="t0">And in Thy presence rest.</p>
</div>
<p>It is a very difficult task to translate these old Latin
hymns; much is lost by the translation. It is not an
easy matter to construct a bridge between the great
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
glow of St. Bernard&rsquo;s mysticism and the powerful, yet
cold faith of the seventeenth century. If &ldquo;Jesu dulcis
memoria&rdquo; was not written by St. Bernard, it must have
been written by one of his devout pupils. We are here
at the very fountain-head of Christian poetry, so closely
related to the Song of Solomon, i. e., it presents the
relation of the faithful to Christ&mdash;the love of the bride
to the bridegroom. From this circle came the great
hymn &ldquo;O Sacred Head, now wounded,&rdquo; translated and
perfected by Paul Gerhardt.</p>
<p>No wonder that the schools and cathedrals clung
so tenaciously to the old Latin hymnody. It exerted
great influence. Too bad, indeed, that we have permitted
this Latin song to become extinct. Perhaps our
taste in things religious would not have declined so
low, and religious song would not have come to be
despised so generally, had our good leaders realized that
there are better things than American jazz.</p>
<h3 id="c11">MEDIAEVAL GERMAN HYMNS</h3>
<p>Along with this Latin-clerical church song there
existed in the Germanic mediaeval Church a religious
popular poetry or congregational song. Under the
hierarchic autocracy of the Gregorian song it had gone
so far that the active participation of the congregation
in public worship was reduced to a joining only in the
response Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy upon us),
repeated one hundred or more times at any one church
service. But in the sad tones of this Kyrie Eleison, this
cry for compassion from a people spiritually oppressed
and enslaved, there emerged in the Germanic mediaeval
Church the first attempts at congregational song in
the vernacular. At the close of the ninth century they
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
began to supply the tune of the mechanically repeated
Kyrie Eleison with religious verses in the language of
the people. Every verse of these songs ended with the
refrain Kyrie Eleison. Thus arose the first German
church hymns called Kirleison or Leisen, as they had
grown out of and ended with the Kyrie Eleison.</p>
<p>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when significant
religious awakenings and the Crusades (1096-1273)
stirred up great enthusiasm among the people,
these German hymns took on new life and gained great
favor among the people. These religious songs of the
people were used more and more freely both in public
worship and at other religious and secular festive occasions.
Some of these mediaeval German hymns or
Leisen are: Also heilig ist der Tag; Mitten wir im Leben
sind; Christ ist erstanden; Nun bitten wir den heiligen
Geist. One of the best of these Leisen is,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Christ ist erstanden</p>
<p class="t0">Von der Marter Banden,</p>
<p class="t0">Des sollen wir alle froh sein,</p>
<p class="t0">Christ will unser Trost sein,</p>
<p class="t2">Kyrie Eleison.</p>
</div>
<p>But even though the people sang these hymns in
the church services, such singing was merely tolerated
and had no set place. These German hymns of the
people were different from the Latin hymns of the
cloisters. They possess a more simple, popular and
hearty key-note, though their form may be poor and
their style rugged. But these hymns, with their singable
tunes, were greatly loved by the people, and so they
lived and thrived in the hearts of the common people
during the deplorable times and conditions of the mediaeval
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Church. The secular Minnesingers (thirteenth
century) and the Meistersingers (fourteenth century)
exerted considerable influence upon German hymnody,
especially with respect to poetic form and music. In the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the &ldquo;Brethren of the
Common Life&rdquo; (Netherlands) and the significant religious
movements associated with John Wycliffe and
John Huss gave to hymnody in the vernacular a powerful
revival and a purer evangelical content. Desirable
Latin hymns were translated and new hymns in the
vernacular were written. The Germans and the Bohemians
possessed, before 1500, about five hundred church
hymns in the vernacular. In the fifteenth century the
Bohemians sang these hymns in the regular church
services.</p>
<h3 id="c12">MEDIAEVAL SCANDINAVIAN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>Because of the close connection which existed in
mediaeval times between Germanic countries and peoples,&mdash;a
natural outcome of their racial affinity,&mdash;it was
quite natural that the movements of mediaeval hymnody
in Germany would become known among the people of
the North. The Swedish mediaeval Church possessed
a hymnody both in Latin and in Swedish. Only a very
few of the Swedish mediaeval religious songs remain
to-day. These popular religious songs, like secular
folk songs and ballads, were transmitted not in writing
but as a living tradition on the lips of the people
from generation to generation. Thus only very few
of these old Swedish religious songs have survived the
century of the Reformation. By way of example we
may note the old mediaeval song, &ldquo;The blessed day
which we behold&rdquo;&mdash;this is found in all Swedish Lutheran
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
hymn books. It existed in the fourteenth century.
In its present form it has been greatly improved
by the greatest of Swedish hymnologists, J. O. Wallin.
Ericus Olai is the only known Swedish hymn writer of
mediaeval times. One of his hymns, &ldquo;The Rich Man,&rdquo;
a metrical paraphrase of the Gospel lesson which deals
with the rich man and Lazarus, Olaus Petri, the great
Swedish reformer, included in the first Swedish Lutheran
hymn book. It was also included in the Swedish Lutheran
hymn book of 1695. An interesting and valuable
testimony concerning the fact that also in the Swedish
mediaeval Church the people were allowed to sing in
public worship, is found in the answer that King Gustavus
I gave to the complaint of the Dalecarlians, in
1527. Among other things, the king says that &ldquo;it is an
old custom in our country, in our churches, to sing in
Swedish and praise God, and it is well that this is
done in our own language, which we understand, and
not in Latin, which we do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c13">THE SEQUENCES</h3>
<p>The Sequences were religious liturgical songs,
which developed from the florid vocalizations upon the
last syllable of the Hallelujah. At first only a melody
or tune with words, but later on it became an art form
both in music and in sacred poetry. Musically often
of finer quality than the hymn. The Sequences usually
consisted of two verses, three lines to each verse, with
the same melody for each of the two verses. The form
seems to have originated at the convent of St. Gall in
Switzerland, about 875 A. D. During the later part
of the mediaeval era the Sequences became very popular,
and the number of Sequences that were sung in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Catholic Church reached nearly one thousand. The
church music decisions of the Council of Trent (1545-1563)
operated very strongly against the Sequences,
and so they practically disappeared about 1570. Only
five Sequences were retained, namely, Victime paschali
laudes, Veni Sancte Spiritus, Lauda Sion salvatorem,
Stabat Mater dolorosa, and Dies Irae.</p>
<h3 id="c14">ST. GALL</h3>
<p>We close our study of mediaeval hymnody with a
story about St. Gall. St. Gall is a very remarkable old
monastery. Men of quite different minds and dispositions
got along very amicably under the Benedictine
rule at St. Gall. Among its one hundred monks there
were in the ninth century four monks whose names were
well known throughout the Western Church, namely, the
learned Ratpert, the enthusiastic Notker, the highly
gifted and greatly admired artist Tutilo, and the unrivalled
hand-printer of books, Sintram, whose very
beautiful handwriting was greatly admired throughout
Europe. Ratpert, a stern educator, never sparing the
rod, and not deeply interested in his devotional exercises&mdash;a
great scholar. Notker Balbulus (stammerer),
the saint-like, ascetic tune-writer and plant specialist,
who had strange visions and lived in another world&mdash;a
dreamer. Then there was also the ingenious, humorous
Tutilo. These three monks were as different as three
highly gifted persons could be, and yet they were always
as one soul. Ratpert respected Tutilo&rsquo;s fine scholarship;
at night they were often found with Notker Balbulus
in the writing-room, comparing and improving the
works that Sintram was about to copy. Notker who
wrote many fine hymn tunes, wanted them sung by
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Tutilo who was a good singer and clever performer
upon several musical instruments. Tutilo wrote several
excellent hymn tunes, and he also produced several noble
hymns of which the most popular are Hodie cantandus,
Viri Galilei, and Gaudete et cantate.</p>
<p>Notker&rsquo;s genuine affection for Tutilo was not disturbed
by Tutilo&rsquo;s good-natured submission to unreasonable
monastic regulations, which Notker regarded as
symbolically significant. The Benedictine regulations
were meant for the monasteries of southern Italy, and
did not suit the convent of St. Gall very well. A midday
nap was one of the Benedictine regulations, and
so the monks of St. Gall had to retire and sleep two
or three hours at midday every day. The Benedictine
rule prescribed a diet of fish, fruit and vegetables&mdash;the
usual diet of southern Italy. But fish and fruit were
difficult to secure at St. Gall; meat, which was plentiful,
was forbidden. And so the diet of St. Gall consisted
mainly of pulse and pap. Notker who was the guardian
of the discipline of the monastery, never had an
occasion to bring up any reproach against Tutilo. Tutilo
observed the midday nap, and flavoured with merriment
the monotonous diet which maintained his splendid mortal
clay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c15">SECTION  V
<br />LUTHERAN HYMNOLOGY
<br />1520&mdash;</h2>
<p>The Reformation of the sixteenth century put life
into congregational hymn singing. Before this time it
had been heard only in strains, broken, timid, and
vague. The Reformation endowed congregational hymn
singing with a sonorousness and power, as never before
in the history of the Church. One of the main principles
of the Reformation was that all Christians, as a spiritual
priesthood (Rev. 1:6 and 1 Pet. 2:5), are privileged
and obliged to approach God and bring Him their offering,
without human mediators and deputies, only because
of the merits of Christ, the one true mediator;
and this not only individually in private life but also
in public worship. The Reformation brought into play
all serviceable forces and means to promote and make
possible the realization of this principle in the cultus.
The reformers sought to make the liturgy intelligible
and accessible to the common people&mdash;for the Latin they
substituted the language of the people, and the congregation
was given an opportunity to take an active part
in public worship. It was perfectly natural that church
song could not remain in its mediaeval form, an exclusive
privilege of the clergy, but be transferred to the
people. And so popular church hymns were produced.
Luther became the leader also in this great work. What
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
kind of hymns he wanted, is quite clearly seen in one
of his letters to the electoral court chaplain, Spalatin,
whom he called upon to assist in this hymnological
work: &ldquo;I am willing to make German psalms for the
people, after the example of the prophets and the ancient
fathers; that is, spiritual hymns whereby the
Word of God, through singing, may conserve itself
among the people.&rdquo; Later on in the same letter, he
makes the following suggestion: &ldquo;I desire, however, that
new-fangled words, and courtly expressions, be omitted,
in order that the language may be the simplest and most
familiar to the people, and yet, at the same time, pure,
and well suited to the clear sense of the psalm.&rdquo; Such
church hymns, thoroughly Biblical and at the same time
popular, the great reformer wanted for the people. And
Luther produced several church hymns, which have
never been surpassed and rarely equaled. He translated
and versified Davidic Psalms; he translated and
revised old Latin hymns; he revised several old religious
folk songs; and he wrote several original hymns. He
was not alone in this hymnological work; many able
assistants came forward. Thus the great Lutheran
hymnody began.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The outstanding merit of these church hymns is
that they proclaim and extol God&rsquo;s great works of love,
in words and strains that burst forth from the very
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
soul of the people&mdash;immediately they became the property
of the people. As silent and yet as most eloquent
witnesses of evangelical truth, these hymns made their
way even to distant lands and awakened the languishing
hearts of the people to new life, to joy and praise.
The annals of the Reformation are rich in the most
remarkable testimonies concerning these things, how
the Lutheran hymns powerfully conquered the love of
the people and how the people heartily sang them in the
churches and in the homes, in weal and woe. And
this great legacy from the Reformation era, the Lutheran
Church has preserved, used well, and richly increased.
The church hymn is the special glory of the
Lutheran Church. No church communion can be compared
to the Lutheran Church in this respect. Not without
reason has the Lutheran Church been called the
singing church.</p>
<h3 id="c16">MARTIN LUTHER</h3>
<p>When we think of the Lutheran hymnody from the
historical point of view, we must dwell, if but briefly,
on its classical formation in the motherland of the
Lutheran Church, Germany. Something permanent and
peculiarly typical is present in the hymnody of the
Reformation days.</p>
<p>With respect to Luther himself, his best hymns are
our most precious possession. &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg&rdquo; is
known the world over. Christians everywhere are familiar
with it.</p>
<p>At first Luther did not seem to be aware of his
poetical gifts. It was not until in July, 1523, when two
Belgian martyrs of the Lutheran Church had been burnt
at the stake, that Luther&rsquo;s first poetical product came
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
into existence&mdash;in the folk song style. This song, &ldquo;Ein
neues Lied wir heben an,&rdquo; spread very rapidly throughout
Germany. Soon thereafter came two hymns, one
about penance, and one about faith: &ldquo;Out of the depths
I cry to Thee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear Christians one and all rejoice.&rdquo;
They were supplied with tunes and spread very rapidly
throughout the land.</p>
<p>1524 was the hymn-year of the Reformation. 24
of Luther&rsquo;s 37 hymns appeared in various publications.
&ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg&rdquo; seems to belong to the year 1527.
Luther&rsquo;s musical assistants were Conrad Rupf and Johann
Walther. It is said that while these two musicians
sat at the table, busy with the writing of the music,
Luther walked about the large room and tried the tunes,
singing them, or playing them on his flute. When we
stop to consider what was then formed and created,
we see clearly that this is a historical situation of epoch-making
significance. Luther at the church door in Wittenberg,
Luther at Worms, at Wartburg, in his home;
so also Luther with his musical friends, creating or
remodelling poetry and music for the new Church&mdash;a
central figure in the history of the Church.</p>
<p>To characterize Luther&rsquo;s hymns is no easy task,
because of their richness. Luther&rsquo;s soul possessed an
enormous span of faith and spiritual life. It experienced
the mediaeval thunder-tones of judgment as well as the
brightness of the Gospel. Compare, for example, the
two hymns, &ldquo;Though in midst of life we be&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear
Christians one and all rejoice.&rdquo; Compare the following
stanza from &ldquo;Ein feste Burg,&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Word they still shall let remain,</p>
<p class="t">Nor any thanks have for it;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s by our side upon the plain</p>
<p class="t">With His good gifts and Spirit.</p>
<p class="t2">Take they then our life,</p>
<p class="t2">Goods, fame, child, and wife,</p>
<p class="t2">When their worst is done,</p>
<p class="t2">They yet have nothing won:</p>
<p class="t">The Kingdom ours remaineth.</p>
</div>
<p>with one of the stanzas from &ldquo;Vom Himmel hoch da
komm ich her&rdquo;,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah, dearest Jesus, Holy Child,</p>
<p class="t0">Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,</p>
<p class="t0">Here in my poor heart&rsquo;s inmost shrine,</p>
<p class="t0">That I may evermore be Thine.</p>
</div>
<p>It is obvious that in &ldquo;Dear Christians one and all
rejoice&rdquo;&mdash;Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g&rsquo;mein&mdash;we
have the outline of Luther&rsquo;s entire experience of faith,
from the moment he felt himself condemned by God
till he could triumph in songs of praise. This hymn
forms a very clear parallel to his exposition of the
Second Article.</p>
<p class="tb">Most of Luther&rsquo;s hymns ought to be found in our
English Lutheran hymn books. They are noble church
hymns&mdash;all Lutherans should know them. The Church
Militant is one of Luther&rsquo;s chief subjects. Note his
great heroic hymn &ldquo;Ein feste Burg.&rdquo; Note also one
of his last hymns:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort</p>
<p class="t0">Und steure deiner Feinde Mord,</p>
<p class="t0">(Original: und steur des Pabsts und Tuerken Mord).</p>
<p class="t0">Die Jesum Christum, deinen Sohn,</p>
<p class="t0">Stuerzen wollen von deinem Thron.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy Word;</p>
<p class="t0">Curb those who fain by craft or sword</p>
<p class="t0">Would wrest the kingdom from Thy Son,</p>
<p class="t0">And set at naught all He hath done.</p>
</div>
<p>Powerful and courageous Lutheran hymns! Ach
Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein&mdash;Look down, O Lord,
from heaven behold&mdash;seems to be as valid against the
disintegrating subjectivism and super-culture of our
time as against the age in which it was born, which dissolved
God&rsquo;s kingdom and divine will at pleasure and
put uncontrolled human will in their place. Whether
this refers to clericalism and papism or modern culture
and mass dominion, makes little or no difference; the
result in both cases is destruction.</p>
<p>Nearly all of Luther&rsquo;s hymns close with words of
praise&mdash;note this consciousness of communion with
Christ. Take for example the last stanza of &ldquo;Christ
lag in Todesbanden&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then let us feast this Easter day</p>
<p class="t0">On the true Bread of heaven;</p>
<p class="t0">The Word of grace hath purged away</p>
<p class="t0">The old and wicked leaven:</p>
<p class="t0">Christ alone our souls will feed;</p>
<p class="t0">He is our meat and drink indeed;</p>
<p class="t0">Faith lives upon no other!</p>
<p class="t3">Alleluia!</p>
</div>
<p>We recommend a careful study of &ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s
Hymns&rdquo; by James F. Lambert.</p>
<h3 id="c17">GERMAN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>The history of German hymnody after 1500 may
be divided into five periods: 1) the foundation period,
including the time of the Reformation and down to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
close of the sixteenth century; 2) the period of prosperity,
from about 1600 to about 1700; 3) the period of
subjectivism, embracing the time from 1700 to 1750;
4) the period of decline, from 1750 to about 1820; 5)
a time of renovation and general development, from
about 1820 to about 1900.</p>
<p>To present a clear, yet reasonably complete, survey
of the history of the church hymn in Germany during
the century of the Reformation, is not an easy task.
The period is rich in victories and reverses. It embraces
not only the first victories of the new Church
but also the Counter-Reformation with its regaining of
lost ground. It includes the sad story of the internal
struggles of the early Lutheran Church, which resulted
in dissension and weakness, bitterness and discouragement.
All this is reflected in the hymnody of the Church.
The sixteenth century produced many great hymnists, to
whom we are greatly indebted. Luther&rsquo;s hymns alone
would form a valuable little hymn book. But it would
be still more valuable, if we included in it the best Lutheran
church hymns of the entire century. A hymn
book containing all the great Lutheran church hymns
of the sixteenth century&mdash;a remarkable Lutheran hymn
book.</p>
<p>The Reformation hymnody possesses a preponderatingly
objective character. Definite and true evangelical
faith is its keynote. Christ&rsquo;s redemption and the
sinner&rsquo;s justification by faith are the outstanding expressions
in this hymnody. The human and the individual,
the subjective, receives a secondary place. In
fact there is hardly any indication in this hymnody of
a proper coalescence of the subjective and the objective.
A great many of the hymns are translations of old
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Greek and Latin hymns. But the thoughts are hearty,
vigorous, powerful, and serious. The outward form
is simple, even faulty at times. Yet it is the song of
earnest and sincere Christians.</p>
<p>The foremost hymnist of this period is, of course,
Martin Luther. Other great hymnists of this period
are Justus Jonas, Paul Eber, Paul Speratus, Nikolaus
Decius, Lazarus Spengler, Nikolaus Hermann, Barthol.
Ringwaldt, and Nikolaus Selnecker. Michael Weiss of
Bohemia belongs to this period, because he produced a
number of excellent German translations of church
hymns which had been in use among the followers of
John Huss.</p>
<p>The second period of German hymnody, the seventeenth
century, may be regarded as one of great prosperity.
In it the objective and the subjective seem
to attain a fine balance. The church hymn now comes
more directly from the soul of the communion of the
faithful. In form and expression there is healthy progress.
A very fine type of lyrical poetry develops. During
the first years of this period we note such excellent
hymnists as L. Helmbold, Martin Schalling,
Valerius Herberger, and Philipp Nicolai. Among hymn
writers during the hard times of the Thirty Years War,
who produced excellent hymns of consolation, powerful
hymns, we note especially John Heermann, Paul Fleming,
J. M. Meyfart, Martin Rinkart, John Rist, and Simon
Dach. The objective-subjective hymnody of the seventeenth
century, in its purest and noblest form, is to be
found in the hymns of Paul Gerhardt, writer of more
than one hundred hymns, in which the ardor and fervor
of Christian subjectivity attained a most happy
union with the firm evangelical faith and the noble
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
popular elements of the Reformation period. He is one
of the greatest German hymn writers, if not the greatest.
With him we note Georg Neumark, J. Franck, and M.
Schirmer.</p>
<p>The third period, from the end of the seventeenth
century to about 1750, may be called the age of subjective
hymnody. To this period belong such great hymn writers
as Johann Scheffler (Angelus Silesius) and Countess
Ludemilia Elisabeth of Schwartzburg-Rudolstadt. Both
of these hymn writers are quite strongly inclined towards
sound Mysticism. At the opening of the eighteenth
century, Pietism brought about a great awakening in
hymn writing. Several of the followers of Spener and
Francke produced a large number of devotional hymns
which are full of sound and sincere piety in simple
and noble form. To this group of hymn writers belong
Samuel Rodigast, Gottfried Arnold, Johann Freylinghausen,
Herrnschmidt, Richter, Countess Emilie Juliane
of Schwartzburg, J. J. Rambach, and Woltersdorf. In this
connection we must also mention Gerhard Tersteegen, a
preacher without a church, and a leader among &ldquo;awakened
souls.&rdquo; The followers of J. A. Bengel, or the so-called
Bible Theologians, produced a number of fine devotional
hymns. Leading hymn writers in this group are Johann
Mentzer and Phillip Friedrich Hiller. Count Zinzendorf,
the great leader among the Herrnhuters, or
Moravian Brethren, wrote a number of excellent hymns.
Besides these hymnological fruits of Pietism, the orthodox
tendency did not remain unproductive. Pietism
exerted considerable influence upon the orthodox hymnody.
To this group of orthodox hymn writers belong
Erdmann Neumeister, Benjamin Schmolck, and Salomo
Franck. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
a dull and degraded Pietism began to react upon sacred
poetry. A sound and vigorous tone was superseded by
the subjective and lyrical effusions of the individual.
The hymns began to treat more and more of personal
feelings and soul experiences, of events and situations
in private life. A number of poor hymn books appeared.
Public taste for the right kind of church song
was spoiled. This paved the way for a hymnological
revolution, brought about mainly by Rationalism, during
the last half of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The fourth period, the era of decline, includes the
last half of the eighteenth century and the first decades
of the nineteenth. This is the time of the destructive
influences of Neologism or Rationalism in Germany.
German hymnody suffered. Rationalism is a denial of
positive Christian life, and lacks sympathy for the primitive,
the simple, and the popular. It cannot attend to
the needs of the common people. It possesses a character
of superficial and heartless intellectualism. Reason was
made the highest authority in all religious matters.
Genuine hymn writing could not grow up in a soil which
was destitute both of poetry and of true Christianity.
The dominion of rationalism in German hymnody began
about the middle of the eighteenth century with a revision
of the old church hymns in accordance with the
new ideas of the age, an age of enlightenment and illumination.
To begin with this hymnological revision
was mainly in the interest of form. Severity, irregularity
and archaism in expression and style, in rhyme and
meter, etc., had to be eliminated from the church hymns.
Up-to-date language had to be used. The revision of
form was soon followed by a revision of content. Old
ideas in the hymns had to be removed. The church
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
hymns had to be in harmony with the new ethical ideas
of the age. A great work in hymnological vandalism
was in progress. It was not sufficient to merely improve
the old hymns. Most of the grand old church hymns
were dropped and new ones produced&mdash;new hymns which
were in perfect harmony with the new ideas of the
age. The new hymn book was to be a kind of textbook
in moral philosophy. The new hymn book should
instruct the people in many useful things. Hymns were
written on such subjects as profitable economy, extravagance,
superstition, scepticism, quiet and peaceful
life, contentedness, integrity, the right use of pleasure,
commerce, agriculture, vaccination, sleep, etc. The direction
was not heavenward so much as worldward.</p>
<p>The leading hymnological revisor or editor was
Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724-1803). He also wrote
a few original hymns. One of the best hymn writers
of this hymnological era was Christian Fuerchtegott
Gellert (1715-1769). He wrote a number of excellent
hymns. Johann Casper Lavater (1741-1801) was perhaps
the greatest hymn writer of this period.</p>
<p>The fifth period of German hymnody, an era of
renovation, from about 1825 to about 1910, is known not so
much for original hymn writing as for its general return
to the best of old German hymnody. The neological
hymn books of the preceding period were condemned
and rejected. New hymn books were published, which
contained the best church hymns of all times. Outstanding
hymnological compilers and editors are Dr.
Hermann Adalbert Daniel, Dr. Carl Eduard Philipp
Wackernagel, and Stip. Albert Knapp and Dr. Carl
Johann Spitta are important German hymnists of this
period. Important English translators are Miss Catherine
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Winkworth, Miss Frances Elizabeth Cox, Miss
Jane Borthwick and her sister&mdash;Mrs. Findlater, Rev.
Richard Massie, and Rev. A. Tozar Russell.</p>
<h3 id="c18">SCANDINAVIAN LUTHERAN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>The Reformation era, the sixteenth century.&mdash;The
hymnody of the Scandinavian Church during this period
was, for the most part, an echo of that of the German
mother Church. Among important hymnists of this
period we note Hans Taussen, Hans Tomiss&ouml;n, Cl.
T&ouml;ndebinder and Nils Jespersen of the Danish Church. In
the Swedish Church we note especially the two brothers,
Olaus and Laurentius Petri, the two great Swedish reformers,
students under Dr. Martin Luther at the University
of Wittenberg. The first Swedish Lutheran
hymn book was issued by Olaus Petri, 1526, called
&ldquo;Swedish Songs&rdquo; (about ten hymns). Revised and
enlarged editions of this hymn book appeared in 1530
and 1536. In this first Swedish Lutheran hymn book
we find hymns by the Swedish poet Olaf Swensson,
who distinguished himself as a zealous polemic against
the Roman Catholic Church and &ldquo;Antichrist&rdquo; (the pope).
In 1567 appeared another Swedish Lutheran hymn book,
containing 99 hymns, which has been called &ldquo;the hymn
book of Laurentius Petri,&rdquo; because it contained many
translations and several original hymns by him. A
revised and enlarged edition of this hymn book appeared
in 1572. In this hymnal appeared the popular and beautiful
Swedish Lutheran hymn, &ldquo;A sinful man, who lay
in trance of sin, he heard a voice from heaven:
Awake, awake, list to the Word that comfort gives.&rdquo;
It has been claimed by several authorities that this hymn
is the foremost hymn in the Swedish literature of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
sixteenth century, and also one of the greatest of Swedish
Lutheran hymns. It is probably the work of Laurentius
Petri Gothus.</p>
<p>Scandinavian Lutheran hymnody may be divided
into five hymnological periods, similar to the five periods
of German Lutheran hymnody. The hymnological
periods of German and Scandinavian hymnody are
parallel.</p>
<p>The second period, the seventeenth century.&mdash;The
seventeenth century is said to be the days of glory in
the history of Scandinavian Lutheran hymnody&mdash;its
foremost period. While the Danish hymnists Hans
Sthen, A. Arreboe, and especially T. Kingo wrote their
hymns, the hymnody of the Swedish Church developed
somewhat independently, with Swedish fervor and virility
in connection with Biblical and practical simplicity
in the best sense. The advance of this period on the
Reformation era was much greater in the Swedish
Church than in the German Church. It is also to be
noted that the highest point in Swedish Lutheran hymn
writing was reached in the later part of the seventeenth
century, somewhat later than in Germany. Important
Swedish hymnists of this period are Samuel Columbus,
Erik Lindsk&ouml;ld, Petrus Brask, Gustaf Ollon, Israel Kolmodin,
Jacob Boethius, Jakob Arrhenius, and especially
the two bishops, Haquin Spegel and Jesper Swedberg.
The Swedish Lutheran hymnal of 1695 was a masterwork.</p>
<p>The third period, from 1700 to 1750.&mdash;The Scandinavian
Church was not subject to the hymnological
fluctuations that the German Church experienced in
this period, because the excellent Swedish hymnal of
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
1695 remained throughout the 18th century as the only
official and popular hymn book. Efforts were made to
produce new hymnals. About 1765 appeared an orthodox
hymnal, &ldquo;sound in doctrine and unpoetical&rdquo;&mdash;called
the Celsic hymnal, because O. Celsius had a great
deal to do with its compilation. Pietistic and Moravianistic
hymnals appeared. As an example of the Pietistic
hymnals we note &ldquo;The Songs of Moses and the
Lamb,&rdquo; by Lybecker, 1717. &ldquo;The Songs of Zion&rdquo; was
a Moravianistic product, published about 1745. The
Danes and the Norwegians were fortunate in having
as their foremost hymnist the great H. A. Brorson, a
most noble Pietistic hymn writer.</p>
<p>The fourth period.&mdash;This period includes the last
half of the eighteenth century and the first fifteen years
of the nineteenth. The neological spirit did not get
into the church life of Sweden as thoroughly as in
Germany. This fortunate condition is plainly seen in
the hymnody of the Swedish Church. The hymnal
that was published in 1793, the year of the 200th anniversary
of the important Church Council at Upsala
(1593), contained very few new hymns, and the old
hymns retained were only slightly revised. But this
hymnal was not accepted by the Swedish Church. About
twenty years later, in 1814, appeared a new project in
the matter of a revised and improved hymnal, the result
of neological efforts to produce new church hymns.
Many very able hymnists united in this great hymnological
project, to show what genius and good taste
can accomplish. It was a great work, but, on the whole,
unsuccessful&mdash;too fine, perhaps.</p>
<p>The fifth period, the nineteenth century.&mdash;The hymnological
situation in Sweden in the nineteenth century
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
was somewhat similar to that in Germany. But it is hardly
a question of returning to the old, because neological
activities were not able to deprive the Swedish Church
of her old hymnody. Efforts to give to the Church a
large number of the best of the old church hymns (Greek,
Latin, German and Scandinavian), carefully edited, and
some new Swedish church hymns, resulted in the important
Swedish Hymnal of 1819. It has remained to
this day (1925) the official and popular Hymnal of the
Swedish Church. It is the Swedish hymn book of the
Augustana Synod. With respect to the old church hymns
in the hymnal, it may be said that much was gained
by this work of revision. Most of the new hymns are
excellent. A few of the hymns betray neological influences.
On the whole, however, the Hymnal of 1819
is a very fine Lutheran hymn book. It contains 500
hymns. Revision is undoubtedly needed, and such work
has been going on for some time.</p>
<p>Among Swedish hymn writers who contributed to
the Hymnal of 1819 we note especially Bishop J. O.
Wallin (died 1839) and Bishop F. M. Franzen (died
1847). Wallin produced 128 original hymns and revised
or translated very many old and new hymns. The
Hymnal of 1819 has often been called Wallin&rsquo;s Hymnal.
Most of his hymns are immortal masterpieces. Franzen
produced 22 original hymns. As a hymnist Franzen
possessed less rhetorical elevation and force than Wallin,
but he is fully equal to Wallin not only in the Biblical-evangelical
quality of the content but also in the lyrical
heartiness of the tone as well as in the transparency and
simplicity of the language. Other important Swedish
hymn writers of this period are Samuel J. Hedborn
(died 1849) and Erik Gustaf Geijer (died 1847). Johan
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Henrik Thomander and Per Wieselgren are the editors
of the Swedish Hymnal (1819) that is used in the
Swedish Lutheran Augustana Synod, U. S. A.</p>
<p>In the Danish Church the well known N. F. S.
Grundtvig (died 1872) has rendered great service as
a reviser of old church hymns and writer of several
excellent original hymns. The Norwegian Lutheran
hymn book by Rev. M. B. Landstad (died 1881) is a
very important hymnological work. It is a popular
hymnal in the Norwegian Church. An important Swedish
hymn book was published in Finland in 1880, which
contained many excellent old church hymns from
Swedish and German sources, but also several new hymns
by such well known Finnish scholars as Johan Ludvig
Runeberg (died 1877), Zacharias Topelius (died 1898),
and others.</p>
<p>Bishop J. O. Wallin brought about a very high
hymnic standard in the Swedish Church&mdash;perhaps the
highest hymnic standard in the entire Lutheran world.
When we examine what Grundtvig and Landstad gave
the Danish and Norwegian churches, we find a great
deal of the folk song element in that hymnody&mdash;not an
unwholesome attribute. Wallin&rsquo;s work belongs rather
to the sphere of the solemn and sublime church hymn.
The hymnody of the Swedish Lutheran Church is among
the finest in the whole field of Lutheran hymnology, a
church hymnody born in the days of the Reformation,
four hundred years ago.</p>
<h3 id="c19">AMERICAN LUTHERAN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>The early Lutherans in America came from lands
where church song had attained high position and where
a large number of noble church hymns had been produced.
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
The early German Lutherans sang from a great
variety of hymn books which they had brought with
them from the homeland. Dr. Henry Eyster Jacobs
makes the following statement in &ldquo;A History of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in the United States&rdquo;:
&ldquo;Muhlenberg had complained greatly of the variety of
hymn books in use in the congregations, and generally
within the same congregation. Of these, the Marburg
hymn book gained precedence, and an American edition
was published by Christopher Saur, Germantown,
in 1762.&rdquo; This hymn book contained over six hundred
hymns.</p>
<p>About the same thing may be said of the earlier
Lutheran immigrants, the Dutch and the Swedes. About
1675 the Swedes appealed to the King of Sweden for
12 Bibles, 100 hymn books, etc. In 1696 a ship carrying
missionaries and a large supply of books left Sweden
for America.</p>
<p>The work of organizing the early Lutheran Church
in America fell to Rev. Dr. Henry Melchior Muhlenberg,
often called the Patriarch of the American Lutheran
Church. He came to Philadelphia in 1742. The
first Evangelical Lutheran Synod in America was organized
by Muhlenberg at Philadelphia in 1748. This body
is known as the Evangelical Lutheran Ministerium of
Pennsylvania and Adjacent States. In 1782 this synod
resolved to have a new hymn book printed for the united
congregations. A hymn book committee was appointed
and given the following instructions: &ldquo;As far as possible
to follow the arrangement of the Halle hymn book,
and not to omit any of the old standard hymns, especially
of Luther and Paul Gerhardt.&rdquo; This German
hymn book appeared in 1786, having been prepared by
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
Muhlenberg, Kunze, and Helmuth. Poor health prevented
Muhlenberg from taking a more active part in
the compilation of this hymn book. While it was used
extensively, it seems that the book did not fully meet
the wishes of the synod. Apparently the active editors,
especially Dr. Helmuth, had not been successful in the
selection and revision of the hymns. The inter-denominational
(Lutheran and Reformed) hymn book of 1817,
the &ldquo;Gemeinschaftliches Gesangbuch,&rdquo; was an inferior
hymnological work. It was meant to take the place
of the Pennsylvania hymn book of 1786. In 1849 the
Ministerium of Pennsylvania published a new hymn
book, prepared chiefly by Dr. C. R. Demme. The Synods
of New York and West Pennsylvania co-operated in this
issue. Although popular, this Pennsylvania hymn book
did not measure up to that of 1786. About the middle
of the nineteenth century, several German Lutheran
hymn books were published by different synods. The
Kirchenbuch of the General Council, published in 1877,
is a hymnological work of high merit.</p>
<p>The first English Lutheran hymn book used in
America was the &ldquo;Psalmodia Germanica&rdquo; of 1725, 1732,
and 1756. It came to America from London, England.
It contained 122 hymns, several by Luther and Paul
Gerhardt. In 1795 Dr. John C. Kunze of New York
published &ldquo;A Hymn and Prayer Book, for the use of
such Lutheran Churches as use the English language.&rdquo;
Its 240 hymns were gathered from German Lutheran,
Moravian, English and American sources. In 1797 Rev.
George Strebeck issued &ldquo;A Collection of Evangelical
Hymns, made from Different Authors and Collections,
for the English Lutheran Church in New York.&rdquo; This
was a rather un-Lutheran hymn book. Rev. Strebeck
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
and his New York congregation went over to the
Protestant Episcopal Church. In 1806 Rev. Ralph Williston
published &ldquo;A Choice Selection of Evangelical
Hymns from Various Authors, for the Use of the English
Lutheran Church in New York.&rdquo; While this hymn
book met with popularity within the New York Ministerium,
it was not a Lutheran hymn book. Most of
its hymns were taken from Watts and Charles Wesley.
Rev. Williston and his New York congregation also
went over to the Protestant Episcopal Church. In 1815
appeared &ldquo;A Collection of Hymns and a Liturgy for the
Use of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.&rdquo; Published by
order of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of the State
of New York. The editors were Drs. Quitman and
Wackerhagen. This book contained 520 carefully selected
hymns.</p>
<p>A number of English hymn books were published
before 1850, but they were found more or less unsatisfactory.
Some of them were quite un-Lutheran. In
1863 the Ministerium of Pennsylvania decided to issue
a new English hymn book. A hymn book committee
was appointed, which did very thorough work. This
resulted in the publication of the Church Book by the
General Council in 1868. This is undoubtedly one of
the best English Lutheran hymn books of the American
Lutheran Church. It has been highly praised by prominent
hymnologists of Europe, and it has remained a
very popular English hymn book throughout the American
Lutheran Church for over fifty years. It has passed
through several editions.</p>
<p>Rev. Justus Falckner (1672-1723) wrote what may
be called the first American Lutheran hymn. He is
said to be the first German Lutheran pastor in America
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
and was ordained by the Swedish Lutheran pastors in
Gloria Dei Church at Wicaco in 1703. This was the
first Lutheran ordination in America. We quote here
the first two stanzas of Rev. Justus Falckner&rsquo;s beautiful
hymn. The hymn was originally written in German&mdash;&ldquo;Auf,
ihr Christen, Christi Glieder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Rise, ye children of salvation,</p>
<p class="t">All who cleave to Christ the Head!</p>
<p class="t0">Wake, arise, O mighty nation,</p>
<p class="t">Ere the foe on Zion tread:</p>
<p class="t0">He draws nigh, and would defy</p>
<p class="t0">All the hosts of God Most High.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saints and heroes, long before us,</p>
<p class="t">Firmly on this ground have stood;</p>
<p class="t0">See their banner waving o&rsquo;er us,</p>
<p class="t">Conquerors through the Saviour&rsquo;s Blood!</p>
<p class="t0">Ground we hold, whereon of old</p>
<p class="t0">Fought the faithful and the bold.</p>
</div>
<p>The American Lutheran Church cannot as yet point
to an American Lutheran hymnist like Paul Gerhardt
or John Olof Wallin. The English Lutheran hymn
books in America contain translations of German, Scandinavian,
old Greek, and old Latin hymns, also a large
number of carefully selected English (Reformed) hymns.
The matter of translating great German and Scandinavian
Lutheran hymns into English is a very difficult
task. But there are Lutherans in America who write
hymns worthy of more general acceptance. They would
find it if it were, first of all, accorded to them by their
fellow-Lutherans of other synods. So long as the hymn
writers of another synod are largely ignored in American
Lutheran synodical hymnals, it is not to be expected
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
that what they write will find its way into the hymnals
of other denominations. Among the most successful
translators and hymn writers within the American Lutheran
Church the following may be mentioned: Rev. H.
Brueckner, Rev. Dr. Matthias Loy, Rev. Dr. Charles
Poterfield Krauth, Rev. John Casper Mattes, Rev. Dr.
Alfred Ramsey, Rev. Dr. Charles William Schaeffer,
Rev. Dr. Joseph Augustus Seiss, Mrs. Harriett Reynolds
Spaeth, Rev. Dr. C. H. L. Schuette, Miss Anna
Hoppe, and Rev. Dr. Paul E. Kretzmann. Miss Catherine
Winkworth, Anglican, has produced a large number
of excellent translations of German Lutheran hymns.</p>
<p>Several excellent English Lutheran hymn books
have been published within the American Lutheran
Church. Perhaps the foremost work is the Common
Service Book, authorized by the General Synod, the
General Council, and the United Synod in the South.
The Evangelical Lutheran Hymnal, published by order
of the First English District of the Joint Synod of
Ohio and Other States, is a worthy American Lutheran
hymn book. The Wartburg Hymnal, edited by Professor
O. Hardwig and published by Wartburg Publishing
House, is noteworthy. The Scandinavian Lutherans
have also published commendable hymn books. The
new Hymnal of the Augustana Synod (1925) is excellent.
Hymn book committees are at work on the compilation
of better and more serviceable English Lutheran
hymnals.</p>
<p>The history of hymnody in the American Lutheran
Church is in many respects discouraging. A prominent
American Lutheran theologian recently made the following
statement: &ldquo;Few of our ministers have ever had
an appreciation of the treasures of Lutheran church
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
song&rdquo; The training of the clergy in hymnology and
church music is not what it ought to be. The education
of the church organist and choir director is woefully
deficient. More serious study in liturgics, hymnology
and church music is needed. Yet some very good
work has been done by American Lutheran hymnists,
hymnologists and church musicians. The Memoirs of
the Lutheran Liturgical Association contain much valuable
information concerning American Lutheran church
song; so also the Essays on Church Music, volumes
which contain papers read at Lutheran church music
conventions held chiefly in Pennsylvania. Other sources
of information are: &ldquo;The English Hymn&rdquo; by Dr. Louis
F. Benson, pages 410-420 and 560-563. &ldquo;The Lutheran
Cyclopedia&rdquo; by Jacobs and Haas, pages 235-238 and 96-97.

the United States&rdquo; by Henry Eyster Jacobs, the references

<h2 id="c20">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>How old is Lutheran church song? Four hundred
years&mdash;the historical age of the most vigorous production
in the realm of sacred song. We must not forget
that one thousand popular evangelical Lutheran church
hymns are a selection from perhaps one hundred thousand
church hymns. What a great vital power! Is
there any reason to believe that this vitality is about
to cease? Is Lutheran hymn writing a thing of the
past? The power to create is not yet extinct. The
hymnody of the Church is steadily conquering new
ground. In the Episcopal Church the church hymn has
taken on greater and greater significance. Wherever
evangelical missionary work is gaining ground, the
church hymns find favor. So long as the Lutheran
Church lives, Lutheran church song will flourish.</p>
<p>Even from the literary point of view, this Lutheran
hymnic vitality ought to be appreciated. Is it not
strange that poets whose work will be forgotten after a
few decades, are treated at length in our histories of
literature, while this body of song, which has stood the
test of centuries, scarcely receives mention? Yet our
Lutheran church hymn has perhaps very few literary
competitors. As a representation of life, does it not
fitly take its place beside the many legends that have
delighted the children of old India, or Homer&rsquo;s Iliad
and Odyssey, or the metrical romances of the Middle
Ages, or Dante&rsquo;s Divine Comedy, or a great Shakespearean
drama, or the songs of the Israelites?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>But it is not because the Lutheran church hymn is
great poetry that it lives. It is because of the life of
the Church, the life of souls, the life of the Christian
faith, that the church hymn lives. From this it draws
its life and becomes an ever fresh source of spiritual
life.</p>
<p>Looking at the church hymn from this point of
view, looking at the content of the church hymn, the
outlook widens and goes far beyond the time of four
hundred years.</p>
<p>If the history of our evangelical church hymn has
reference more particularly to the historical evolution
of the content and the making of the form, then this
history embraces several thousand years of the religious
development of our race. This holds good also from
the literary point of view. It is obvious that our popular
Lutheran church hymns contain material from all
classical ages revealed by history, from the first literary
days of old Israel down to the present time, and this
very often in the most intimate fusion.</p>
<p>Take for example one of F. M. Franzen&rsquo;s greatest
hymns, the first stanza of which follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Prepare the way, O Zion!</p>
<p class="t0">Ye awful deeps, rise high,</p>
<p class="t0">Sink low, ye towering mountains;</p>
<p class="t0">The Lord is drawing nigh:</p>
<p class="t0">The righteous King of glory,</p>
<p class="t0">Foretold in sacred story.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, blest is He that came</p>
<p class="t0">In God the Father&rsquo;s Name!</p>
</div>
<p>How much there is in that stanza! And it is only
the first stanza of a truly great Lutheran church hymn.
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
In all this, which may seem quite commonplace, there
really is something truly wonderful; an old, old story
about the life of faith and its expression in song and
worship&mdash;an exceedingly beautiful testimony about the
fulness of God&rsquo;s work in the history of spiritual life on
earth.</p>
<p>Our hymnological annotations must draw to a close.
They may be regarded as observations and reflections
during the study of a great subject: Our Lutheran church
song. Perhaps they will be of some value to those who
have much to do with Lutheran hymn singing as well
as to those who teach and instruct our young people
in this branch of our ecclesiastical inheritance.</p>
<p>Much must be done before we can really claim that
the American Lutheran Church has fully taken over
this rich legacy.</p>
<p>A church hymn sung by a Lutheran congregation
as it should be sung&mdash;that may at first thought seem
to be a very simple and insignificant matter. But taken
in its historical and religious connections, the matter
is far from simple or insignificant. And taken as a
problem&mdash;it is not easily solved. Its relations to the
facts and conditions of spiritual life extend far and
wide. Hymnological study gives us an idea of these
things. Our Lutheran hymnody is four hundred years
old&mdash;many of our best Lutheran hymns are four hundred
years old&mdash;four hundred years, think of it, full
of ups and downs, ecclesiastically and politically&mdash;four
hundred years of sacred song through all kinds of significant
life experiences. Four hundred years&mdash;turn to
mediaeval and modern history.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of the church hymn, we
may lay down as a fundamental principle that the church
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
hymn cannot live without connection with the life that
has passed through the ages, from the prophets of old,
Christ, the Reformation, and down to the present. Only
in this connection does the church hymn possess a positive
significance or the significance of a life-promoting
factor.</p>
<p>The correctness of this principle may be confirmed
from actual experience. In the history of languishing
and dying church song, we can read about languishing
and dying Christian nations&mdash;nations in deplorable condition
both ecclesiastically and nationally&mdash;nations of
emigration, non-patriotism, and of little or no sense of
duty&mdash;nations of imported religious thinking and poorly
translated songs.</p>
<p>The question has often been raised: Does the American
Lutheran Church really sing? Yes and No&mdash;for
the most part No. Most of our American Lutheran
country congregations do not sing. How about the
city churches? A sad affair! In most cases the situation
is far from ideal. A church hymn, <i>a Lutheran
church hymn</i>, cannot be sung properly by those who
forget God, Bible, history, etc., in order to practise a
little general culture and enjoy a little tasty personal
aesthetics. If a noble Lutheran church hymn is sung,
it is usually sung by the choir, perhaps as a concert
number, disconnected from its vital connection. And
detached from its connection, the noble Lutheran church
hymn becomes, like everything else that has vital significance,
nothing. That which does not really hang
together, becomes patchwork, bandages, finery, rags&mdash;we
may praise it enthusiastically. Very much like American
culture&mdash;sorry to say. Uniting, cementing, productive
LIFE is lacking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Many American Lutheran churches do not sing
Lutheran church hymns at all. How deplorable! We
often attend Lutheran church services where not a single
Lutheran church hymn or Lutheran chorale is sung.
Here is a serious flaw in American Lutheran education
and leadership. How about the hymn singing in our
American Lutheran Sunday schools? Would it not be
well to sing at least one Lutheran church hymn each
Sunday? Or shall we permit Lutheran hymnody to
die? Is great Lutheran hymnody a thing of the past?</p>
<p>But what is the most serious thing that our American
Lutheran congregational hymn singing lacks? One
thing&mdash;LIFE. That is our great problem&mdash;life in our
church song&mdash;new life&mdash;LIFE. With this go all the
difficulties of the problem of life.</p>
<p>Since it is the business of the Church to sing the
church hymn, the question becomes very complicated.
So many factors must co-operate in this matter, if we
are to get anywhere&mdash;to sing a Lutheran church hymn
as it should be sung. Our American Lutheran colleges
and theological seminaries will have to undertake more
serious educational work in the important field of hymnology
and church music. A strong summer school of
Lutheran church music, liturgics and hymnology would
be very valuable.</p>
<p>Take the familiar situation: The great festival
hymn of the Reformation is sung. We have before us
altar, pulpit, pipe organ; we have before us minister,
organist, choir, congregation. The ideal of the problem
is a <i>harmonious co-operation</i> between all if we are to
have VITAL worship and VITAL song.</p>
<p>The good pastor of a large Lutheran church in
Connecticut thanked his organist and choirmaster in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
very hearty way after a fine Sunday morning service.
The good organist and choirmaster answered: &ldquo;Well,
who cannot play and sing when the pastor preaches such
soul-stirring sermons and conducts the liturgy so beautifully?&rdquo;
And the good pastor replied: &ldquo;Well, who
cannot preach and conduct the liturgy when the organist
and choirmaster does such excellent work?&rdquo; That is real
co-operation&mdash;they helped each other in a beautiful way.
They co-operated in the selection of hymns and choir
music&mdash;every Tuesday or Wednesday evening that pastor
and organist were together in conference concerning
the song of the church. That is work very much worth
while for the Church service.</p>
<p>In our thousands of Lutheran churches throughout
the United States of America, the American Lutheran
Church is to be built up and built together into ONE
great Church, into ONE people that really sings&mdash;a
people of God.</p>

<h2 id="c21">ADDENDA
<br />REFORMED CHURCH SONG</h2>
<p>The founders of the so-called Reformed Church,
Ulrich Zwingli and John Calvin, sought to restore apostolic
simplicity in the matter of public worship. All
images and ornaments were removed from the Reformed
churches. The altars were changed to plain tables.
Musical instruments were not allowed in the churches.
Zwingli made the sermon the chief part of the church
service. The Latin chants and songs were abolished,
and their places were seldom filled with congregational
singing in the vernacular. With regard to church service,
Calvin had on the whole the same views as Zwingli.
He introduced, however, congregational singing, using
translated and versified portions of the Psalms of
David.</p>
<p>Thus the Reformed Church turned to Biblical
Psalmody. Early versifiers of Davidic Psalms were
Clement Marot (1495-1544), Theodore Beza (1519-1605),
and Ambrosius Lobwasser (1515-1585). Joachim Neander
(1650-1680), Gerhard Tersteegen (1697-1769), and
Lavater (died 1801) are important Reformed hymnists.
The Genevan Psalter, by Marot and Beza, a successful
and influential hymnological work, appeared about the
middle of the sixteenth century. Ambrosius Lobwasser
produced a German edition of the Genevan Psalter in
1573, which became very popular and exerted considerable
influence. English Psalmody presents such important
names as Miles Coverdale (1487-1569), George
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Buchanan (1506-1582), Thomas Sternhold (sixteenth
century), John Hopkins, Nahum Tate, Nicholas Brady,
and Isaac Watts. In Scotch Psalmody the Royal Psalter
and the celebrated Rous&rsquo; Version are significant
hymnological works. The Bay Psalmist or the New
England Version was America&rsquo;s first hymn book. For
further study of Reformed church song we recommend
&ldquo;The Hymn as Literature,&rdquo; by J. B. Reeves, also Benson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The English Hymn.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c23">FOOTNOTES</h2>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>The first Lutheran hymn book was &ldquo;Etlich Christliche
Lieder&rdquo; of 1524. This little hymn book may have been published
without Luther&rsquo;s assistance. Perhaps the most important hymn
book, containing a number of Luther&rsquo;s hymns, was &ldquo;Geistliches
Gesangbuechlein&rdquo; of 1524. &ldquo;Enchiridion oder ein Handbuechlein&rdquo;
appeared in 1524. Other important hymn books appeared
in 1526, 1531, and 1535.

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
